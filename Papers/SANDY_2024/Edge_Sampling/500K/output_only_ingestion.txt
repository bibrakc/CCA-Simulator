Creating the simulation environment that includes the CCA Chip: 

CCA Chip Details:
	Shape: square
	Dim: 32 x 32

The graph: /N/u/bchandio/BigRed200/Research/git_repos/Datasets/Dynamic/Edge_Sampling/500K/simulated_blockmodel_graph_500000_nodes_edgeSample.edgelist_1 has total_vertices: 500000 with 1016373 egdes.
Allocating vertices cyclically on the CCA Chip: 
Vertex id 0 will be allocated first by the allocator. Then the rest of the vertices will follow based on the allocator type.
Shuffled the vertex id list for random allocation of vertices. May help with synthetic graphs where the graph generator didn't do a good job.
